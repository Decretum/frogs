There's an event in Onmyoji, a game I play, where you're fighting these other guys and you have to figure out who the imposter is by looking in the audience. It's pretty straightforward, and any normal person would just write down the names of the people in the audience in sticky notes or something, but I figured it'd be easier to just click on buttons instead of having to type things out.

Basically, I look to see who's in the audience, click on those people to mark them as "disabled", and I can figure out who the imposter is from what's left.
